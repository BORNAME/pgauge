             ==         PGauge - Performance Gauge         ==
             ================================================

1. What is PGauge?
---------------------
PGauge is an HLA performance testing application. It can be used to benchmark
the throughput and latency of a particular RTI implementation.

If currently supports the following HLA interfaces:

    - HLA v1.3 (Java)
    - HLA v1.3 (C++)
        - Windows
        - Linux
        - Mac OS X

Support for IEEE-1516 is planned by not yet implemented.

2. Getting Started
---------------------
To start a PGauge federation test, use the provided scripts. Passing "--help" to each
of them will generate and print command-line argument assistance to screen.

All scripts are provided in two forms: Bash Shell Script and Windows Batch file.
The scripts are contained in the following directories:

   [PGAUGE_HOME]
     |-- bin
         |-- rti-environment         (RTI location configuration)
         |-- rti-environment.bat     (RTI location configuration)
         `-- java
             |-- exmanager           (Execution Manager - *nix)
             |-- exmanager.bat       (Execution Manager - Windows)
             `-- throughput 
                 |-- listener        (Throughput Listener Federate)
                 |-- listener.bat    (Throughput Listener Federate)
                 |-- sender          (Throughput Sender Federate)
                 |-- sender.bat      (Throughput Sender Federate)
             `-- latency
                 |-- requester       (Latency Requester Federate)
                 |-- requester.bat   (Latency Requester Federate)
                 |-- responder       (Latency Responder Federate)
                 |-- responder.bat   (Latenry Responder Federate)
         `cpp
             |-- exmanager           
             |-- exmanager.bat       
             `-- throughput 
                 |-- listener        
                 |-- listener.bat    
                 |-- sender          
                 |-- sender.bat      
             `-- latency
                 |-- requester       
                 |-- requester.bat   
                 |-- responder       
                 |-- responder.bat   

RTI Location Inforamtion
==========================
PGauge has been designed to support other RTIs in addition to Portico. Inside the main
bin directory you will find RTI environment setup scripts. These are called by each of
the federate scripts before they start so that they can get their appropriate setup.

To change to a different RTI or point PGague at the location of your RTI, edit these
environment files. Typically a user will need to specify their Portico installation
location at the least.


Throughput Test
=================
This scenario uses a number of senders and receivers to measure raw throughput
performance of the RTI. Senders put their traffic on the network, while receivers
listen for it. A clock is started at commencement and stopped when all federates
have reached the final synchronization point. The receivers will not achieve this
point until they have received all the messages they expect.

Each loop, the sender federate sends out a reflection for each of the objects that
it has created. It also sends out an interaction. You can run as many senders and
receiver federates as you like.

For each sender/receiver you can specify:

  - The number of interations for the test
  - The number of objects to update each iteration
  - The payload size that is sent with each update/interaction
  - Whether or not time management should be used

To run the simulation, start the execution manager and then start your preferred number
of senders and receivers.

 **NOTE** Ensure that the object/iteration counts are the same across all federates


Latency Test
=================
The latency test consists of two federates: a requester and a responder.
Not surprisingly, the requester sends out a ping requests, to which the
responder replies. The round-trip time of the activity is measured and
presented as the latency.

This volley is completed a number of times to get the average. The user can
specify:

  - The number of iterations to run the test over
  - The payload sent with each ping and response

To run the simulation, start the execution manager and then start a single requester
and responder federate.

 **NOTE** For Portico, be sure to disable bundling in the RTI.rid file first
          unless you want to skew the results
