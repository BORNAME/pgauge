If you are reading this, you are most likely looking around for the pguage
source code. Well, you can stop looking because it isn't in here!

As such, if you are one of the few people who want the source code, you can
check it out of the public Sourceforge Subversion repository from the following
URL:

https://portico.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/portico/tools/pguage

The pguage build system is the same as the Portico build system. For information
on how to work in this environment, see the Portico documentation:

http://porticoproject.org/index.php?title=Building_Portico

If you have any more questions, be sure to ask them!! Just jump on the forums
and we'll do our best to get everything sorted out:

Cheers,
The Portico development team
